## Context

Recently, I've been reading ferociously like this ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/4K55PfPOhIrIY/giphy.gif)

I enter this state every once in a while. Not particularly fear of missing out, but just feel too comfortable. Maybe it's time to take a look outside of my comfort zone, see what's going on.

However, **this time is different**. I am constantly overloading my mental pipeline which does ETL[^1] to convert info into knowledge for me.

Heuristically, I categorize info into **3 buckets**, by which to determine if some materials need further processing.

1. Ideas I knew by heart.
   - It may be presented differently but I got it. Good to reinforce what knew.
2. Ideas help construct new connections of existing knowledge.
   - It's a trigger to help realize the possibility to connect existing dots differently. Sense of enlightenment, but nothing radical.
3. Ideas introduce whole new perspective.
   - Like the brain goes from cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. Not only see new things differently, existing internal knowledge structure is transforming along with it. The effect has two fold:
     - fast: Immediate brain dead. I'll just freeze. No repulsive rejection because I knew I hit something, but can't say what it is.
     - slow: The beauty is here. My brain's physical structure is literally changing. It will take a while for new perspective to break, reorg and merge with whatever I have in my brain, like fermentation. This is gold[^2], and where how I do annotation matters a lot.

My recent reads mostly land in category 3, hence the kernel panic. Could be the world is changing exponentially but I'm not, or I somehow get way better at google and research. Regardless the reason, I have to seize the chance to internalize as much as possible so those new ideas won't just be words I read before, but concrete frameworks in my brain to help me making better decision in the future.

## Role of annotation

I can brute force through cases in category 1 and 2. For cat 1, could just forget it. Cat 2, write it down few times, compose a quick learning note or write a prototype program to connect dots should be enough. Cat 3 is whole new level. Opportunity like this is like a baby, I need to create an environment in which idea could grow and get strong over time.

In this book, [How to read a book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Book-Classic-Intelligent/dp/0671212095), it introduce the idea of highest level of reading: **syntopical reading**. Basically you compare and contrast a set of ideas to understand the shape and interconnections of them. Those forms the conceptual framework of the subject.

In order to compare and contrast the elements and relationships of new perspective, you need a group of people analyzing, discussing, question and answering and find references over a period of time, typical research process. However, I found it hard to find a group of people to tackle something of my interest at the right space time. So usually I have to simulate a group of people with myself by creating few personas working on the same problem at the same time.

Simulation is important because you need various attack angles to dissect the subject. Idealist, pragmatist, technologist, politician and businessman will see things differently. By finding the right incentive to unite different personas, I have a chance to get the complete picture of new perspective. Usually, a new perspective is how things could work differently. Clash of personas is key to make it work.

Back to annotation. It serves two purpose to facilitate such simulation:

1. Keep records of interactions.
2. Provide decent visual data representation to facilitate further interactions and final interpretation.

So I just need a tool to talk to myself and its UI/UX are good enough for me to understand the chaos of comparative reading over a period of time. I call this kind of annotation **evergreen notes**[^3]

Many tools can achieve these goals but I want more.

## Insufficient tool

I have been using the combination of PDF reader, MS Word, MindMap software and flowchart to get it done. It's ok. The biggest pain is they are designed to be used by human only. Each one of them have proprietary data format and the UI is for human interaction. Therefore, the process and idea development through them are bound to be limited by human capacity.
