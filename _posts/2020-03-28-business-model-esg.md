Business model is how companies transform product value to profit and sustainability. Profit is the only important metric to evaluate successful company, for now.

If business model is not aligned with stakeholders, the business will fail.

Google/FB are in advertisement business, attention economy. Advertisers are the one who pay. Their incentives are super aligned in a great market, hence they are successful company, 500bn+ market cap. Just unfortunate that it takes 10 years for regular users, including me, to start thinking this is not ok.

Yes I got amazing services for FREE, at what expense? Took a while to understand what's the cost, personal data, privacy, control, choice ....

The idea of [ESG, environment, social and governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance), is brewing right now. CEO in big corps even signed a **Statement on the purpose of corporation**[^1]:

> While each of our individual companies serves its own corporate purpose, we share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders

Stakeholder used to mean shareholder only. Now it's expanded to include customer, employee, supplier and community. News like this [Top U.S. CEOs say companies should put social responsibility above profit](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-jp-morgan-business-roundtable-idUSKCN1V91EK) are all over major news outlets around Aug/2019.

It's right direction. Has short term PR value. May be able to lay the ground work for steering public opinions to pave the way for next wave of antitrust. However I don't expect swift behavior changes from big corps. Business model dictates options of action. Successful corps need time, rather long period of time to migrate entrenched business model, if not impossible.

For established corp, ESG means cost and risk. To comply or not both impose different kind of risk.  
For startup, this is great time to think about how to unbundle dominant player's offerings with ESG built-in by design.
